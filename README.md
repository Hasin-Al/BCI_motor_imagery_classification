# BCI_motor_imagery_classification
In this project, First i have extracted needed information from EEG dataset[Data Set 1, from Berlin, the 100Hz version in MATLAB format]. Then convert the file into time segmentized epoch file using MNE package of python .Then done some filtering and preprocessing. After that, create a pipe line and classify BCI signals and then evaluate the performance.
Task Overview:
This data set represents segmented raw time series of EEG readings. You need to pre-process it and perform exploratory data analysis to get a good feel for the data and prepare the data for machine learning. Train different classifiers to assign class labels to the test data to indicate which activity the subject was performing while the data were collected.
