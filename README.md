# BCI_motor_imagery_classification
In this project, First i have extracted needed information from a matlab file. Then convert the file into time segmentized epoch file using MNE package of python .Then done some filtering and preprocessing. After that, create a pipe line and classify BCI signals and then evaluate the performance.
